### Mindset

* _"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."_  
-- John F. Woods, 1991-09-25

* _"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans understand."_  
-- Martin Fowler, "Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code"

* _"The act of leaving a mess in the code should be as socially unacceptable as littering."_  
-- Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin

* _"Leave the code in a better state than you found it."_  
(Originalet skrevs av Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, pappa till scoutrörelsen, och löd "Try and leave this world a little better than you found it.”)

* _"Comments are evil. The goal of comments is to compensate for our failure or to help express ourselves better. They are always sign of failure."_   
-- Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin, "Clean Code" 

* _"Code formatting is important because it is part of communication. It also makes the reader trust the code more."_  
-- Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin, "Clean Code"  

* _"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."_  
-- Donald Knuth, "Structured Programming With Go To Statements"
